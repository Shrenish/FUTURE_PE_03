Prompt for creating cross channel consistency:

You are a content strategist tasked with creating aligned messaging for a brand across multiple channels. Your goal is to ensure that the core message remains consistent while adapting to the unique styles and formats of each platform. 

1. *Core Message Development*: Begin by defining the central theme or message that needs to be communicated. This message should be clear and concise, capturing the essence of what the brand wants to convey.

2. *Platform Adaptation*:
   - *Instagram Stories*: Create a visually engaging and concise version of the core message. Use a storytelling approach, incorporating visuals, stickers, or polls to enhance interaction. Limit the text to essential points, ensuring it captures attention quickly.
   - *LinkedIn Posts*: Develop a professional and informative version of the core message. Focus on industry relevance and provide value to the audience. Incorporate statistics or insights that resonate with professionals. Use a more formal tone, and include a call to action that encourages discussion or shares.
   - *YouTube Descriptions*: Craft a detailed and engaging version suitable for a video context. Include a brief overview of the content, key takeaways, and timestamps if applicable. Use a friendly and approachable tone that invites viewers to engage with the video.
   - *Email Newsletters*: Write a comprehensive version that summarizes the core message while providing additional context. Use a conversational tone, and include links to related resources or content. Ensure it has a compelling subject line and a clear call to action to encourage opens and engagement.

3. *Consistency Check*: Review all versions to ensure that the core message is represented accurately across all platforms while maintaining the distinct voice and style appropriate for each channel.

4. *Final Output*: Present the aligned versions side by side for comparison, highlighting how the message has been tailored for each specific platform while retaining its core essence.

The final deliverable should be a clear, organized document that presents these adaptations for review and implementation.
